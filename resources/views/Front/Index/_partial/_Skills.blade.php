                    <p>
                        Considering that nowadays all sites are moving towards SPA (Single Page Applications), one of the musts is to know RESTful API.

                        I have worked with many databases and have done projects with many of them, but I can claim that I can learn new databases just by reading the documents once.

                        In many of the projects that I had in Iran, many of the group work issues such as Trello (for example) were not followed, but at the same time, I worked with different tools in different projects.
